Maintaining Eye Contact
-----------------------
Keep consistent eye contact to show engagement and attention. This demonstrates that you 
are actively participating in the conversation and value what the speaker is saying.

Nodding and Acknowledgment

When something is unclear, ask specific questions to ensure you understand correctly:

Paraphrasing

Repeat what you heard in your own words to confirm understanding:
- "So what you're saying is..."
- "If I understand correctly, you're suggesting..."
- "Let me make sure I've got this right..."

Avoiding Interruptions

Let the speaker finish their thoughts before responding. If you need to interject, use 
polite phrases like "May I add something here?" or "If I could just mention..."
